# pulse-filtering

Program to process radiation signals coming from a plastic scintillator. 

The processing is divided in three steps:
 1- Event selection: Eliminating waveforms not suitable for the analysis.
 2.-Pulse filtering: Baseline elimination and high frequency noise reduction.
 3.-Syncronization (optional): Use constant fraction timing to syncronize events.
